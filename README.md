# SneakRead · 摸鱼

**Read the web at your desk, disguised as the tool you already have open.**

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE) · [sneakread.com](https://sneakread.com) · 100% client-side, no backend, no tracking · [中文](README.zh.md)

Paste any public URL. SneakRead reads it through `r.jina.ai`, then renders it **full-screen as a real desktop app** — VS Code, Word, Google Docs, Excel, or Outlook — so reading looks like working. Brand: **SneakRead** globally, **摸鱼** in Chinese.

The design goal is 以假乱真 (indistinguishable from the real thing), modelled on
[remoteok.com/vscode](https://remoteok.com/vscode) / `/docx` / `/docs`:

- **One app fills the whole viewport** at `/` — the landing *is* the reader, defaulting to the Word disguise. No wrapper — only the target app's own title bar (with the real brand logo), ribbon/activity bar, and status bar. (`/app` is a legacy alias that redirects to `/`.)
- **Every control is hidden** behind the disguise's real **File menu** and a command palette (`⌘K` / `⌘P`): open URLs, switch apps, language, refresh, fullscreen, panic.
- **Boss key.** Press `Esc` (or lose window focus with Boss auto-hide on) to instantly flip to a plausible `Q3 Budget Review.xlsx`. `Esc` again restores.
- **Continuous browsing.** Every skin has clickable links; clicking one loads it through the reader in the *current* disguise.
- The browser tab title and favicon match the disguise, never the brand.

## Landing & SEO

The marketing pages are static, prerendered, and localized into 10 languages,
yet **themselves disguised** as a VS Code README (with a live Version switcher):

- `/`, `/zh`, `/es`, `/hi`, `/ar`, `/pt`, `/ru`, `/ja`, `/fr`, `/de` — each static HTML with localized `<title>`/description, canonical, `hreflang` (+ `x-default`), Open Graph, and `FAQPage` JSON-LD. `sitemap.xml` + `robots.txt` included.
- Features and FAQ are real, crawlable text rendered inside the disguise.
- The `/app` alias is `noindex`; opened documents live in the `#u=…` hash, never a crawlable path.

## Getting around

- **The File menu is real.** Every skin's `File` opens a working menu: Open URL, Home, Open as (each app), **Language**, Refresh, Fullscreen, Boss auto-hide, Panic, and "What is Moyu?".
- **Command menu** (`⌘K` / `⌘P`): the same actions for keyboard users; paste a URL to open it.
- **In-app browsing.** Click any link inside a document and it loads through the reader in the *current* skin, so you browse article to article without ever leaving the disguise. `⌘/Ctrl`-click opens the real page in a new tab.
- **First-run onboarding** explains the three controls, once, then never again.
- **Localized** into the browser's language across the top 10 (en, zh, es, hi, ar, pt, ru, ja, fr, de); switchable from File ▸ Language. Disguise chrome stays in its native app language.

## Skins

| Skin | Looks like | Content shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VS Code | full workbench: activity bar, explorer, syntax-highlighted editor, terminal, dark preview | source markdown |
| Word | title bar, ribbon, ruler, paper on canvas, status bar | clean article |
| Google Docs | doc top bar, menu, toolbar pill, page | clean article |
| Excel | ribbon, formula bar, real grid, sheet tabs | data table if present, else audit sheet |
| Outlook | folders, message list, reading pane | article as an email |

The skin is inferred from the URL/content and can be switched anytime from the palette.

## Stack

- **Vite + React + TypeScript**, no backend — everything runs in the browser.
- **Reader with front-end fallback**: Jina (`r.jinaai.cn` → `r.jina.ai`) → Firecrawl (keyless). Network-adaptive order, remembers the last-good provider, per-provider timeouts + cooldowns. No API key ever ships in the client.
- **Real vendor assets** for pixel fidelity: [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) (the actual VS Code editor, lazy-loaded) for the VS Code skin, [Codicons](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-codicons), [Fluent UI icons](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-system-icons) for Office, [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons) for Docs, and self-hosted metric-compatible fonts (Inter/Carlito/Roboto/Cascadia Code).
- React Markdown + GFM for rendered content; a modelled FY P&L (with formulas + chart) for the boss-key sheet.
- Dependency-free i18n across 10 languages; SSG landing pages via a small prerender script.

## Develop

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # http://localhost:5173  (the landing IS the reader)
pnpm build      # static site into dist/ (client + prerendered landing pages)
```

## Contribute a skin

SneakRead is built to be extended — **new disguises are the most welcome kind of
contribution.** A skin is a [`SkinDefinition`](src/skins/types.ts) (id, label, app
name, accent) plus a React component that renders a `DocumentRecord` as that app.
Each of the five built-in disguises lives in its own [`src/skins/<name>/`](src/skins/)
folder and auto-registers via `import.meta.glob`; copy [`src/skins/_template/`](src/skins/_template/)
to start. See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for the interface, the
add-a-skin walkthrough, and the 以假乱真 fidelity checklist.
